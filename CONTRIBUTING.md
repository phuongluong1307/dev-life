## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dev-life.git
   cd dev-life
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
4. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your API keys to .env
   ```
5. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development mode
bun dev

# Run linter
bun run lint

# Format code
bun run format

# Lint + format with auto-fix
bun run check
```

### Project Architecture

- **`src/main/`** — Electron main process (Node.js runtime)
- **`src/preload/`** — Preload scripts for secure IPC bridge
- **`src/renderer/`** — React frontend (browser runtime)

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code passes all lint checks: `bun run check`
2. Update documentation if your change affects public APIs or user-facing behavior
3. Write a clear PR title following the [commit convention](#commit-convention)
4. Fill out the PR template with a description of your changes
5. Request review from at least one maintainer

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles without errors (`bun run build`)
- [ ] Linter passes (`bun run check`)
- [ ] Changes are documented (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit messages follow the convention

## Coding Standards

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Configuration is in [`biome.json`](biome.json).

### Key Rules

- **Indent**: 2 spaces
- **Quotes**: Single quotes
- **Semicolons**: Only when required (ASI-safe)
- **Line width**: 100 characters max
- **Imports**: Auto-organized by Biome

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript — avoid `any` when possible
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use explicit return types for exported functions

## Commit Convention

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
